    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <h2> Catherine Purushottam</h2>
       <p>My name is Catherine, from India and I am Web Design and Development major, and this is my second semester which makes me a Junior. I hope to get into designing as well as development of websites. I am married and mother of a 3-year-old, so needless to say, my favorite thing to do is sleep.</p>
    <p>As for my career, I have some experience in video editing and I loved it, therefore I am also taking Video Production as a cluster to still pursue my passion. As an international student, I love that BYUI is a church university that allows me to learn and strengthen my faith while educating myself.</p>
    <p>I want to pursue a career in web designing and for that, I also need to learn how websites are developed. However, I was a Comm major in my last semester, so I know absolutely nothing about coding, so I hope I can learn and grasp it well. I am diving headfirst :D</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 13 years now. Overall, I am really nervous to take this course but hope to get comfortable as I progress. </p>
